<p class="message" style="text-align:center">
    These are some interesting thoughts compiled after my first experiment on 
    <a href="http://community-lab.net/">CommunityLab</a> testbed, a project which I am a former developer.
</p>


1. **Change your mindset, think big**

    *"You don't have a bunch of slivers, you have a distributed system"*
    
    Create large slices to compensate for offline nodes and other failures.
    
    Automate *everything*, you don't want to manually login into any sliver.


2. **Make your experiments idempotent**

    Nodes come and go, you can not assume all your slivers being on the same state.
    
    Design experiments in such a way that can run on both, fresh and already deployed nodes.


3. **Use concurrency for experiment deployment and for collecting the results**

    You *really* don't want to sequentially wait for half of your slivers timing out their SSH connections.
    
    Use scripting languages like Bash. Bash integrates process management into the language itself.
    Just imagine how this will look like if written with Java's threading library:
    
    ```bash
    cat sliver-mgmt-ip.list | while read IP; do
        {
          scp -o stricthostkeychecking=no experiment.sh root@[$IP]: &&
          ssh root@$IP "nohup bash experiment.sh" ;
        } &
    done
    ```

4. **CONFINE REST API doesn't love you too much**

    It's a *node-oriented API*, not *researcher-oriented*. Some *essential information* for your experiments may be cumbersome to obtain.
    
    This snippet exemplifies how to get all the management IPs of your slivers in order to be able to start with your experiment.
    
    ```python
    SLICE_ID = 249
    
    # API calls
    # Requires "pip install confine-orm"
    from orm.api import Api
    controller = Api('https://controller.community-lab.net/api/')
    slivers = controller.slivers.retrieve()
    slivers.retrieve_related('node', 'slice')
    
    # Calculate sliver MGMT IP according to CONFINE addressing specs
    # https://wiki.confine-project.eu/arch:addressing
    MGMT_IPV6_PREFIX = controller.testbed_params.mgmt_ipv6_prefix
    int_to_hex_str = lambda i,l: ('%.' + str(l) + 'x') % i
    split_by_len = lambda s,l: [s[i:i+l] for i in range(0, len(s), l)]
    for sliver in slivers.filter(slice__id=SLICE_ID):
        node_id = sliver.node.id
        slice_id = sliver.slice.id
        for iface in sliver.interfaces:
            if iface.type == 'management':
                nr = '10' + int_to_hex_str(iface.nr, 2)
                node_id = int_to_hex_str(node_id, 4)
                slice_id = int_to_hex_str(slice_id, 12)
                ipv6_words = MGMT_IPV6_PREFIX.split(':')[:3]
                ipv6_words.extend([node_id, nr])
                ipv6_words.extend(split_by_len(slice_id, 4))
                print ':'.join(ipv6_words)
                break
    ```

5. **Pre-compile things on your own i686 virtual machine**

    Common sliver free space is arround ~700MB, which may be not enough for installing required dev libraries and compiling your average C++ application.
    
    Moreover, doing so in an overcrowded Intel Atom machine will take like... I don't know; 10x more than in your high-end desktop?


6. **Be prepared for network issues**

    Not all nodes have Internet connectivity, `apt-get install` will not always work.

    Network splits are common around community networks. You may end-up having multiple isolated experiments rather than a single one.


7. **Common development tools and network utils are missing :(**

    For sure your `experiment.sh` will need to start with something like this (with hope for Internet connectivity being available):
    
    ```bash
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y inetutils-ping git traceroute tcpdump nano strace screen
    ```
    
    You also can [create your own sliver templates](https://wiki.confine-project.eu/soft:debian-template), but you'll have to learn a few things that you don't want to.


8. **Did you forgot to set the slice state to start?**
    
    Me too :)
